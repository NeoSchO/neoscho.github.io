title: WHITNESSING IN COMPUTATIONAL ART
---

There was much conflict in my mind when thinking about the moral and ethical principles when it comes to “seeing” places though digital technologies. Clouds over Sidra is built as an empathy machine. It was made to bring thought and attention to an important crisis, but how does the VR impression and experience present this issue. 

When Clouds over Sidra was shown to the delegates at the World Economic Forum 2016, they all donated at the end. But I couldn’t help but think would this have been the case if they viewed it at home by themselves? I feel like this is a very powerful social experiment, being in a room surrounded by people with a lot of money and asked to donate you wouldn’t want to be seen as heartless and unsympathetic, so everybody said yes. If they saw it at home, they might have done the same, but the motivations could have been slightly different. There are a lot of other things to take into consideration here, but this is a thought that would be interesting to further investigate. 

Where does the responsibility lie? Does it shift onto the 12-year-old girl in the video to get help, onto the viewers to do something about this crisis. In class when we had to do an exercise which involved my standing there being looked at through a camera with my eyes closed then open with no movement or conversation, I felt very observed but in an extremely objectified way which felt extremely dehumanizing. Just now when writing this makes me realise the way this little girl could have felt having this extreme weight and pressure out on her.
