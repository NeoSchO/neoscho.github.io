title: WITH WINNIE SOON
---

On the 24th of we had a guest lecture with Winnie Soon who is an artist-researcher. Her works converge over the areas of media 
and computational art, software studies, cultural studies and code practice. 

In preparation for the lecture we had to read three texts. These texts ranged over different ideas surrounding machine 
learning, giving a range of perspectives into the emerging ubiquitous nature of AI. 

The first paper ‘Anatomy of an AI System’ breaks down the Amazon Echo into its manufacturing process, the human labour used to 
make these systems and the resources it takes to do so. It’s not just about the Echo, this paper highlights the background of 
the tools we use today like smartphones and laptops and how we can be so oblivious to the damage the that these products are 
having on the earth. There is so little information out there about where the parts that make up these ubiquitous machines 
come from and it is not easily found. When reading this paper, the thought occurred to me that we are living in an age where 
we are becoming more aware of the impact we are having, (plastic waste is a perfect example) but something that is surrounding
us on a daily basis can be so overlooked. These tools take all of our data, using it to build up their neural networks, they 
are unseen eyes and ears that spy on us and this is overlooked and ignored because it doesn’t exactly make one feel 
comfortable.  This information of ours is being owned by the wrong people, the information that is used for corporate benefit 
and against the few. When you look under these shells there is exploitation of humans and the natural resources on the world. 

The next two papers ‘Assessing Censorship on Microblogs in China’ and ‘Unrolling the Learning Curve: Aesthetics of Adaptive 
Behaviours with Deep Recurrent Nets for Text Generation’ I found harder to digest. They focus on the more technical side on 
these deep learning algorithms and how they work. Even though the algorithms in these papers are being used for both very 
different things they are giving us an insight into different ways of thinking and understanding. Though these systems can be 
dangerous for building further understandings of the future because all of the predictions of the computer are based on the 
past.
