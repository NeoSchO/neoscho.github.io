title: AESTHETIC PRACTICE IN BIOMETRICS
---


Zach Blas’s work gets one to reflect on their own identify through the scope of biometrics. The practice of Zach Blas spans through a range of mediums, not only just art but events, experiences and learning opportunities. By bringing his art and research into communities it opens up the knowledge by making it accessible and perceivable to the public. I feel that this approach needs to delve into many subjects of computation rather than being a mysterious entity behind a curtain. 

In reflection to his themes this is important because this is something that ubiquitously effects all of us. His works have a unifying quality, breaking down and revealing the problems of racism, discrimination and social inequality. Programme’s that have been trained on only white men can be racist and sexist by not being able to detect race or sex properly, creating troublesome problems. It needs to be of upmost importance to programmers to make sure their facial recognising programme are unbiased and able to be tailored to all people. 

For Blas’s project called ‘Face Cages’ he created masks out of biometric diagrams for face recognition. By bringing these forms into the physical space and how the wears of the mask look and feel it really brings the dehumanization of these biometric scans. You can feel the physical struggle of the wearer of the mask, the encapsulation of their physical self which is reflecting the encapsulating of the real human behind this basic form of data.
