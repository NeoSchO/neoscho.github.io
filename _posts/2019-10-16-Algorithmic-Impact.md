Algorithmic Impact
In our last class we discussed the text ‘Algorithm [draft] [#digitalkeywords]’ by Tarleton Gillespie. This text looks at the 
way the word algorithm is interpreted by different people in different areas and professions. The way we value this word is 
based on our understanding, experience and fascinations. 

There is not much general knowledge of how algorithms work to the general public, so I feel they can be misinterpreted and 
misunderstood in what they do and how they do what they do. Not being understood very well there is a shroud that covers up 
giving it a sense of mystery and power in itself. This thought brings me to one of the parts of the text I found very 
interesting and that is how corporations can hide behind their algorithms. Because of the lack of understanding based around 
it, human error or improper judgment can now be blamed on the algorithms that they use. 

Moving on from that thought I want to talk about how algorithms effect our life. They are ubiquitous in our lives. They are 
helping me spell as I write these sentences, help us figure out bus times, show us 100 pairs of glasses online an hour after 
talking to your friend about them on Facebook messenger. They are everywhere. In some ways they are fantastic, they give us 
the chance to focus on doing and learning other things, giving us more freedom in our busy lives to peruse higher goals. But 
are we outsourcing our memory too much? We need to take more time in our lives to consider what information we find valuable. 
We need to judge on what knowledge is important to us. We can’t outsource all of the knowledge to the algorithms that surround
us otherwise we might become empty shells. We can’t just hand everything over and stop thinking. This is why further 
understanding of algorithms and how they affect our lives needs to become taught, to become common knowledge.
