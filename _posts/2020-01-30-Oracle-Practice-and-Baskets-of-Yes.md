title: ORACLE PRACTICE AND BASKETS OF YES
---

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend either lecture last week based around Black Feminist Technology Studies due to clashes with classes the exhibition. It was a shame, this being an area I am not familiar with it would have been a great opportunity to find out more about this area. 

I haven’t personally engaged with Black Feminist thought in the past on a deep level, in some of my past projects I have looked into ways of advocating equality and empowerment through current and past happenings that still hold resonance in our culture. ‘Send & Perceive’ looked at ways entertainment and news can be smuggled into countries that where their media experience is filled with propaganda and indoctrination for example in North Korea. ‘Early Bird’ is a stop motion animation created in reflection to a voice recording called ‘Not Enough Time’ by Tiffany Dufu, which focuses on feelings of inadequacies women face due to the over whelming self-pressure of not being able to achieve as much as a person would like to achieve in a day. ‘Censored Apartheid’ focused on media such as literature, music and film that were banned during apartheid because they promoted ideas of freedom and equality. Thinking about these previous works in connection to Black Feminist thought I can see some links in relation towards the ideas promoted within it but has given way to further realisation about how the intersectionality of the black queer feminist community can be omitted and overlooked. 

Black Feminist thought is something that will definitely reshape my practice in the future. It is important to think about how the narrative of my projects will be seen by not only black queer feminist communities but other overshadowed bodies.
