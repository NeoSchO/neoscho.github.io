Transitioning between worlds and dimensions. It is a beautiful and creative world, full of colour, movement and strange 
creatures. Here I feel like I could be anyone or anything. When you picture yourself in this world you don’t see how you 
look in this meat space, you are the product of the surrounding chaos, bursting with light, full of richness and vigour. 
There is limitless room for exploration and play. I feel a little disoriented at times, it can be quite hard to control, 
and camera and it can sometimes spin out, but when this is not the case, it feels like swimming through a dream. Each 
encounter becomes more bizarre but yet comfortably familiar. Even though this space in enticing me deeper to explore its 
depths there is something missing in this experience. I feel like an observer, an onlooker. There are limitations holding 
me back. The lack of control and interactivity with the world raises a barrier between the two. Nevertheless, when I think 
about the author of the piece, I can’t help but feel like I’m immersed in their mind, floating through the pure creativity 
of it. I would love to spend hours in this world taking time to focus on the details of creating building bridges to the 
thoughts and reasons for these creations. What do they represent? How has this thing come into being? In what relation does 
it have to the outside world? Endless possibilities with Endless questions. If I were to take on this role of creating a 
universe, I wonder what it would hold. If I were to pour myself into it. It makes me feel a little nervous thinking about 
letting people in this world, it exposes you in a way, opens the door for everybody to see. Even so it would be incredible 
letting people engage and explore this world of yours, building their own relations with the world further adding to its 
complexity.
