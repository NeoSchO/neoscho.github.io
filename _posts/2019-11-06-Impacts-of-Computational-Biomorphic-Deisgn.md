title: IMPACTS OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOMORPHIC DESIGN
---

The initial article I chose to share for my group project was based on a project called ‘Transmission’, which was both an 
audio-visual, interactive performance and a research project. I felt this article was relevant as it both focused on the 
technical aim of the performance in the practice but also on its emotional aim on the viewer/user.  This project focuses on 
the idea of interactivity and how its immersive qualities can touch on questions of a philosophical nature as well as 
questions of identity. They suggest that these experiences focus on the invisible dynamics of this work going past the 
physical involvement and building deeper connection to phycological engagement. “Transmission focuses on interaction with the 
self”. In their research they look at the correlation between interactivity, immersion and the feelings involved in this, 
which is being done directly through questionnaires and indirectly though EEG scanners compared with parts of the experience. 
I believe these experiences have meditative qualities putting the user/viewer through the individuals current experience a 
phycological state is developed. An interesting point to consider on the user’s behalf is the how the perception fails to 
accurately acknowledge the role of technology in the experience.
                                                          

With this in mind I have been comparing the ideas of this research into the ideas of Biomorphism. I read a paper on cognitive 
and evolutionary speculations for biomorphic architecture and how it can provoke subtle shifts in human thinking. The reason 
for me choosing this paper is that in a lot of computational art a lot of the visuals are inspired by nature but when looking 
on why people use nature in design biomorphic architecture is has more on the study of how these natural visuals affect us and 
why we use them. I would like to combine these ideas of thinking into the computational art world and see why this nature 
influenced design is important to us. In the article it states that the brain has evolved in a biocentric world which got me 
to thinking, in the future after many years in the future will we evolve and adapt into a technological world. Biophilic design
is associated with positive emotional states, will the design of technology also become a pattern that we become accustom to in
the same way? Over time natures impressions and experiences have affected our thoughts and knowledge, will the rise of 
technology have an impact on our genetic epistemology.


The paper states that ‘increasing urbanisation has negative implications for our psychological wellbeing, because exposure to 
the natural form is often drastically reduced in such environments’. It goes on to say biomorphic architecture can provide a 
counterweight to this impoverishment. That it can promote emotional wellbeing and positive behaviour. 


When researching a project called ‘Displuvium’ by Fragmentin, I was very interested in some of the information they provided 
in their description where they talk about the roles of fountains and water. “In Ancient Rome for instance, wealthy households 
enclosed an atrium: a semi-covered central room, typically surrounded by porticoes. An opening in the roof lit the house and 
allowed rainwater to flow into a basin known as the displuvium. For the servants who worked in these houses, the displuvium was
a window on an outside world that they were not free to explore. Additionally, occupants could apprise themselves of the 
weather by monitoring the water surface for raindrops. The displuvium was thus an everyday source of distraction and 
information, not unlike the digital screens of today”. This got me onto thinking how even though these natural forms can be 
seen as psychologically beneficial they can also be seen as a way of escape and ignoring the reality of our surroundings. 


Even the construction of the technologies used to show this artwork that preserves nature in its perfect form is not having 
benefits of the planet. Mining of the natural resources and unjust human labour contribute to the idea of this artwork being 
seen as a distraction to the reality of what surrounds it outside of its bubble. 


Our existing ideas of how nature is depicted in computational art are ‘unspoilt’ or ‘pure’. Are these depictions in our urban 
environment serving as a distraction to the intrinsically flawed reality of nature or the reality of the modern world and our 
place within it? Or does it promote transparency with openness, accountability and communication? An ambient form of 
environmental and psychological education.
