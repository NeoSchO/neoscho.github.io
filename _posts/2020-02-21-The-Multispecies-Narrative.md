title: THE MULTISPECIES NARRATIVE
---

Humanity has used technology to wreak havoc on nature. We have recruited tools to establish our place as the dominant species 
on this planet. This has caused into the damage of our ecosystem, pollution and loss of biodiversity. For our future survival 
we must think of new ways of working with technology to protect our planet to work alongside nature seeing it as a teacher 
instead of just using it for its raw materials. Technology gives us the ability to understand and work with nature on various 
different levels.

The multispecies narrative is a subject that is going to be playing a large part in my final research project. The subject of 
nature is something that I have been incorporating into my work the past 6 months and it something I will continue to do with 
a keen passion. Multispecies storytelling blurs the existence of the dualist relation we normally associate ourselves with 
nature, it looks at ourselves and nature as a single entity. It is a critique on the web of power relations, and how we can 
emerge from these prior relations into a new understanding of existence, breaking down the hierarchical structure. Taking other
lives into consideration we can build an understanding of how we can use natural structure and organisms to not only benefit 
ourselves but in the situated environment.

Looking at the biosphere the multispecies practice be broken down into different focused domains: 

-	Geosphere – looks at Earth’s interior, rocks and minerals, landforms and the processes that shape the earth’s surface. 
-	Atmosphere – the envelopment of gasses surrounding the earth retained by its gravity.
-	Hydrosphere – all the waters on the earth’s surface, such as lakes and seas, and sometimes including water over the earth’s 
  surface such as clouds.
-	Microbial – relating to or characteristic of a micro- and macro- organism, especially a bacterium causing disease or 
  fermentation in the biosphere. 
-	Botanical – plants and plant life in the biosphere.
-	Zoological – animals and animal life in the biosphere.
-	Noosphere – a postulated sphere or stage of evolutionary development dominated by consciousness, the mind and interpersonal 
  relationships.

One of the leading designers in the field and who will be a key part in my upcoming research is Neri Oxman. At the MIT Media 
Lab she found and directs the Mediated Matter research group. “Her team conducts research at the intersection of computational 
design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology, and applies that knowledge to design across disciplines, 
media and scales—from the micro scale to the building scale. Oxman’s goal is to augment the relationship between built, 
natural, and biological environments by employing design principles inspired and engineered by Nature and implementing them in 
the invention of novel design technologies. Areas of application include architectural design, product design, fashion design, 
as well as the design of new technologies for digital fabrication and construction.”

Her projects span over solving current issues to building future innovations of having nature integrated into our lives. The 
Silk Pavilion explores the relationship between digital and biological fabrication on product and architectural scales. The 
project Wanderers, An Astrobiological Exploration looks into multi-material 3d printed biological clothing that is capable of 
sustaining our bodies in other planets atmospheres.
