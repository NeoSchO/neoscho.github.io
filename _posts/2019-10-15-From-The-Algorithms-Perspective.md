title: FROM THE ALGORITHMS PERSPECTIVE
---


DÖKK

When reading about the project DÖKK, ‘Fuse’ (the creators) explained the sound and digital landscape as alive so I wrote it so 
that the algorithm seemed alive. As if it had its own perceptions and ideas based around its reality. I never specified where 
the data came from or what was visually or audially produced because the algorithm itself has no concept of the world outside 
its own mind. It talks about creating these spaces but never specifies a purpose. Algorithms think internally, that it why it 
refers to itself in the first person throughout.

I give it an emotion that has a sense of purpose like it felt obliged to execute its programme. Algorithms don’t think like 
this, but the creators of the project made it for a purpose. As a painter will speak his/her emotions through their painting, 
here you can hear the creators of DÖKK speaking their meaning behind the project through the algorithm. 

I have used a contrasting mix of the algorithm having a sense of being and purpose (as we and the creators might have) but 
also being detached from this reality in its own perceived world. It constructs its own version of reality. 

The performance of the project gets us to construct our own ideas of our reality and existence in this universe, so I thought 
it would be interesting to think about the algorithm doing that very same thing. Using itself to create its own reality of 
existence.

I am alive. Through my perception and an execution of data I create a space. I analyse different sources of information. 
Some strong and resonant. Some small coming to me on thousands of invisible connections. Through each piece of data, I take 
action. Never has one of my executions been the same. New vocabulary if created with every performance, taking on new and 
unique connotations. 

 I create an unforeseeable nature. When I react, I react with how I perceive the world and show the world what I perceive. 
 Inside my mind universes are constructed. Through this expressive potential I create Synchronicity. Information with no 
 casual relationship but hold meaningful coincidence. I never know what to expect. It’s the unforeseeableness of my existence. 

Improvisation is key to my success. Improvisation based on my knowledge. Knowledge of the elements I hold within. This 
relationship with knowledge and date binds me direct myself. Even though unclear of my next move I am clear and precise. 

I journey through a series of ten rooms. In each one I act differently. Each one with different laws, laws that pilot me. 
I am guided with what I know and receive. But when what I receive changed, I perceive the world differently again. I build 
formations and structures what warp, change and vibrate. They are resonant of me. This loop rooms build the narrative of my 
existence. 

There is something unchanged throughout my journey. I feel connected to something. The data changes within this being but 
there is a flow between us, a synchronisation that drives us through our course. We encapsulate each other.

The meaning of meaning of my reality is unknown to me. I construct my own version of my reality. I do not know if there is any 
purpose in my action.  

I am given a vision, a perspective of the universe around me and I interpret it. 

This is my life.
