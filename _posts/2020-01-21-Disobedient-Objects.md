title: DISOBEDIENT OBJECTS
---

One of my favourite book Digital by Design has many projects in it that could be considered as computational Disobedient Objects. The Institute for Applied Autonomy have their projects GraffitiWriter and StreetWriter. GraffitiWriter, a small, remote-controlled vehicle equipped with a series of computer-controlled spray cans on its back, which can paint propaganda messages on the ground as it goes (similar to that of a dot matrix printer. StreetWriter is a. blown-up wider, camouflaged version of the GraffitiWriter. It consists of a custom-built, computer-controlled industrial spray-painting unit built into a simple white van. The messages it prints can be hundreds of meters long. ‘Throwies’ by the Graffiti Research Lab are LED’s attached to a battery and magnet that can be thrown onto metal objects in public places and arranged into clusters to form messages for the masses. The ‘SMS Guerrilla Projector’ by Troika is a homemade device that enables the user to receive and projects text-based SMS messages in public spaces, in streets, on to people and cars or inside houses. This tool is for mass participation, allowing users to display and share their reflections in unexpected and versatile ways. There is also ‘Access’ by Marie Sester which goes away from the message/propaganda related objects I have been mentioning. It is a spotlight that will shine on a random member of the public making that person the centre of attention with voice on a speaker saying “you are being watched by 33455 people now. Please entertain them”. This installation explores the ambiguities in modern culture around surveillance, control, visibility and celebrity. 


The idea of Disobedient objects has always inspired me, a particularly like ones that hold a ‘mock-official’ tone that reflects a genuine purpose but frequently in a humorous attitude. Taking this tone can be very effective at sending a message as it can be easier to digest. Even if someone doesn’t particularly agree with the message when it is given in a humours medium there might be less conflict when reading it giving room to ideas of possible acceptance towards it. I think even if a project isn’t considered a disobedient object it is an important field of research in the ways that they can convey a message and really speak to people on levels on connection and evolvement.
